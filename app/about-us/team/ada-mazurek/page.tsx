                            <p>I am passionate about my work because I love what I do! I have a steady source of motivation that drives me to do my best. In my last job, this passion led me to challenge myself daily and learn new skills that I have transferred to my current position.</p> 

                            <p>I have been in recruitment for nearly 8 years, and have been lucky to work with Accept Recruitment to develop their recruitment strategy, progress my career and achieve great goals. I have experience of building contract recruitment teams from the ground up, most recently within Industrial/Driving Estates. I am a strong believer in partnering strategically with both candidates and clients, whilst working to achieve their long-term goals. As Operation Manager, I have big ambitions for the contract division and I look forward to offering my expertise to support business growth.</p>  

                            <p>I have a real passion for driving positive change and playing my part in making sure every individual always feels valued and I love working with clients and candidates who share the same outlook. </p>

                            <p>Away from work, I am a proud owner of a middle dog named Lea. Apart from this I try to keep fit and healthyâ€¦ In the weekdays at least!</p>
